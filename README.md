Fused Orthogonal Alternating Least Squares for Tensor Clustering

Jiacheng Wang and Dan Nicolae

The software folder contains R functions for fused orthogonal alternating least sqaures algorithm for tensor multi-modes clustering.

-  fused-orth_ALS_main.R includes main function for fused orthogonal alternating least sqaures algorithm for clustering over third mode. Multi-modes clustering can be easily extended by adding generalized lasso penalty to first and second modes.
-  demo.R is a toy example for how to implement fused-orth_ALS_main.R
